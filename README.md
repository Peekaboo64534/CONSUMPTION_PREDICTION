# CONSUMPTION_PREDICTION

## Project Overview: Electricity Consumption Prediction

### Objective
The "Electricity Consumption Prediction" project is focused on accurately forecasting household energy consumption to optimize energy usage and reduce associated costs. Utilizing advanced machine learning techniques, the project aims to predict total energy consumption by analyzing various factors such as weather conditions, demographic data, and appliance usage.

### Dataset: IDEAL Household Energy
The dataset for this project was collected from 255 homes in the UK over a two-year period. It provides comprehensive details on energy usage, environmental conditions, and demographic factors.

### Comprehensive Data Capture
The dataset includes the following variables:
- **Electricity and Gas Consumption:** Detailed records of energy usage.
- **Environmental Factors:** Temperature and humidity data.
- **Demographic Data:** Household size, income levels, and energy awareness.
- **Appliance Usage:** Information on the usage patterns of different household appliances.

### Longitudinal Approach
Data collection spanned from August 2016 to June 2018, offering a multi-year, seasonal snapshot of household energy consumption patterns.

### Data Preprocessing and Model Development
The initial dataset was 200GB in size but was efficiently reduced to 100KB through preprocessing. The objective is to leverage this refined dataset to develop a robust machine learning model capable of predicting household electricity consumption in kilowatts based on the input variables.

### Project Goals
- **Accurate Predictions:** Develop a reliable model to forecast electricity consumption.
- **Cost Optimization:** Enable households to reduce energy costs through better consumption predictions.
- **Energy Efficiency:** Support initiatives aimed at optimizing energy usage and enhancing overall efficiency.

This project will provide valuable insights and tools for energy management, benefiting both consumers and energy providers.
